Who are you? What is your background?

I am a life long learning and pursuer of financial independence. I've held many jobs in my life from Uber driver to insurnace sales to Systems Administrator. I've always enjoyed money, economics, and aquariums.


What are your career goals?

To no longer "have" to work for a corporation, and be financially free to do whatever job I want. 


Why did you choose FinTech as a career path?

I forsee this as being a highly lucrative and secure industry to be a part of long term as I pursue my goals.
